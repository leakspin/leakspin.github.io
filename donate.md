# Donations
This is just a list of organizations that I am or have donated to with whatever I deemed fair and just.  
Taxes exist for a reason and that wealth should be used for the greater common: health, education and infrastructures, among other topics. But as the world is unfair, donating is another way to try and help others to cope with living in this damned world.

## Local Organizations (Province of Madrid)
Local organizations not only are helped by your monetary donation but with your time donation. If you could spare some time, you could help them giving them a hand.
