**Archived project, no longer in maintenance**

This was a small and messy project to explore how I could build a Slack bot in PHP. It was fairly easy, but I didn't do it maintainable as I wanted to see how I could attach info into the bot and everything. Also, one of the webcomics stopped posting new strips and I moved to another company, so... Yep.
