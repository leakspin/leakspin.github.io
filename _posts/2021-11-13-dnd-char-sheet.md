DnD 5e Character Sheet was a page in which you could have your character sheet for your DnD 5e character (duh). It was pretty simple, with some functionality, and it had an offline store with basic semaphores for storing data, but when OVH servers in France were on fire, I wasn't doing a backup of the data and... I lost all the data. So, with all the frustration, I stopped maintaining it.
